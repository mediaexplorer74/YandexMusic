# Yandex.Music UWP client (autogenerated sketch only / draft)
![logo](Images/logo.png)

My 2nd attempt to remake YandexMusic uwp app. This is planned as very lite edition of YandexMusic client (with only simplest function: search&play song "item").


## Abstract
At now this thing allows you to get some music analytics music through Yandex integration in the simplest uwp app for Windows 10 / 11.

I decided to share my dialogue with Trae AI.. how to create Yandex Music uwp app "template-prototype". ;)
So, look at Wiki: https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/YandexMusic/wiki/
