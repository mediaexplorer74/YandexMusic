# Yandex.Music 1.0 - lite branch ![logo](Images/logo.png)

My 2nd attempt to remake YandexMusic uwp app. This is planned as very lite edition of YandexMusic client (with only simplest function: search&play song "item").


## Abstract
At now this thing allows you to get some music analytics music through Yandex integration in the simplest uwp app for Windows 10 / 11 (and, perhaps, for W10M, or ol sweet Windows 10 Mobile!)

I decided to share my dialogue with Trae AI.. how to create Yandex Music uwp app "template-prototype". ;)
So, look at Wiki: https://github.com/mediaexplorer74/YandexMusic/wiki/

## Solution (app) structure
- Special uap version of Yandex.Music.Api lib (Win SDK 16299 used. draft)
- Auto-gererated Yandex.Music wp app (Win SDK 16299 used. draft)


## Status 
- Experimenting with Trae IDE
- Work-in-progress

## Description
This project was created as a proof-of-concept over a short amount of time. 
The code may not be perfect. It exists for demonstration and educational purposes. So, it's just-for-fun!

## How to use it / try it
- Use your Desktop PC. Open Yandex Music site via Google Chrome (or Yandex Browser), auth and find Access token (cookee) in Developer Mode.  
- Run my YandexMusic app, tap Settigs, save your token, then try to search&play some song. :)
